## Installation:

Place the dll in the plugins folder, load the game to the start screen and *quit*. This will generate the config for the first time.

**Known Issue:** Food *WILL NOT* show up to be crafted the very first time you load in after install and config generation. **please generate the config, quit and restart.**
			

**Note:** This mod requires JVL (Jotunn the Valheim Lib) and it's dependent HookGenPatcher, it will not work without it.

## To Do/Current Ideas
- [x] add food menu items
- [x] expand menu (done untill H&H is released)
- [ ] localizaion
- [x] add another new processing station for food and expansions
- [x] add new food drops from creatures
- [ ] meals (delayed until H&H)
- [x] config sync

This mod is routinely tested on a dedicated server with a great many other mods. To ensure your crafting stations don't disappear, and that food doesn't turn to dust, please put this on the dedicated server as well as ALL clients.

## Credits
Huge thanks to zarboz, GraveBear, and plumga for helping me get going, setting me up, and encouraging me the whole way! This mod wouldn't exist without them.
Also a big thanks to my "players" on my server (my husband and our good friend) Itsmesds, and JaxomFaux who've helped with ideas and balance from the start. (Bone Appetit's name came from us haning out when itmesds said how about "bone appetit" and it stuck)
